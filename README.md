## Why Koda?

Most AI coding tools are heavy Electron apps or bloated Node servers. Koda is a single 91KB file that does everything you need — no frameworks, no Electron, no 500MB of node_modules at runtime.

- **Lightweight** — 91KB bundled binary. Starts instantly. Uses ~90MB RAM.
- **Streaming** — Tokens stream in real-time. Thinking tags are parsed and styled separately.
- **Diff Preview** — Every file write shows a full color diff before executing.
- **Ctrl+C to stop** — Interrupt the agent mid-run, mid-tool, mid-stream.
- **Works with any LLM** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Ollama, LM Studio, any OpenAI-compatible API.
- **MCP Support** — Connect external tool servers via Model Context Protocol.
- **Undo** — Revert any file change with `/undo`. Full undo stack.
- **Conversations** — Persistent SQLite storage. Switch, fork, resume, export.
- **Context Management** — Auto-compaction, token counting, overflow recovery.
- **Profiles** — Switch between work/personal/local model profiles instantly.
- **Parallel Tools** — Multiple tool calls execute concurrently.
- **Sandboxed** — File operations are restricted to your project directory.

## Install

One command — clones, builds, and puts `koda` in your PATH:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rohit-Yadav-47/koda/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then just run:

```bash
koda
```

### Update

Re-run the same curl command. It detects an existing install and pulls the latest.

### Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohit-Yadav-47/koda.git && cd koda
npm install
npm run build
npm link
koda
```

### Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.koda-app ~/.koda /usr/local/bin/koda
```

---

## First Run

Koda launches an interactive setup wizard on first run. Pick from 8 providers:

| Provider | API URL | Models |
|----------|---------|--------|
| OpenAI | `api.openai.com/v1` | gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini |
| Anthropic | `api.anthropic.com/v1` | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 |
| Groq | `api.groq.com/openai/v1` | llama-3.3-70b |
| Together AI | `api.together.xyz/v1` | meta-llama/Llama-3 |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter.ai/api/v1` | (200+ models) |
| Ollama | `localhost:11434/v1` | (local models) |
| LM Studio | `localhost:1234/v1` | (local models) |
| Custom | (any URL) | (any model) |

Or set manually:

```
/config set api_key sk-your-key-here
/config set api_base_url https://api.openai.com/v1
/config set model gpt-4o
```

---

## Features

### Natural Language Coding

Just type what you want:

```
you ❯ read the package.json and explain this project
you ❯ find all TODO comments in the codebase
you ❯ add error handling to the login function
you ❯ run the tests and fix any failures
you ❯ refactor the auth module to use JWT
you ❯ create a REST API endpoint for user profiles
you ❯ review my staged changes for security issues
```

### Streaming with Thinking Support

Responses stream token-by-token. When models use `<thinking>` tags (like DeepSeek), they're:

- **Stripped during streaming** — no raw tags shown
- **Rendered separately** — displayed as dimmed thinking blocks after the response

An animated spinner shows status at every stage: `calling model...` → `thinking...` → streaming response.

### Diff Preview

Every file write and edit shows a full color diff before executing:

```
  src/auth.ts
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  12 │ - const token = null;
  12 │ + const token = generateJWT(user);
  13 │ + if (!token) throw new AuthError('Token generation failed');
```

### Context Window Management

- **Token estimation** with model-specific limits (gpt-4o: 128k, claude: 200k, gemini: 1M, etc.)
- **Auto-compaction** — old messages are compressed to fit the context window
- **Overflow recovery** — if the API returns a context error, aggressively compacts and retries
- **`/tokens`** — shows a visual bar chart of context usage

### Ctrl+C Interrupt

Press **Ctrl+C** at any time to:
- Abort the API stream mid-response
- Stop tool execution mid-run
- Return to the prompt cleanly

### Undo Stack

Every `write_file` and `edit_file` is tracked. Revert with:

```
you ❯ /undo
  ↩ Reverted edit_file on src/auth.ts
```

### Parallel Tool Execution

When the model calls multiple tools in one response, they execute in parallel. Single tools get individual spinners, multiple tools run concurrently.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Connect external tool servers for extended capabilities:

```
/mcp add filesystem npx @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem /path
/mcp add github npx @anthropic/mcp-server-github
/mcp list
/mcp restart
```

MCP tools are auto-discovered, auto-converted to OpenAI format, and executed alongside built-in tools.

### Profiles

Switch between configurations instantly:

```
/profile work        → saves current API key + URL + model
/profile local       → saves another config
/profile work        → switches back to work config
/profiles            → lists all saved profiles
```

### Live Command Picker

Type `/` and get a fuzzy-filtered command list with arrow-key navigation and tab completion.

### Multi-line Input

Use `"""` delimiters for multi-line prompts:

```
you ❯ """
create a function that:
1. validates email
2. checks DNS records
3. returns true/false
"""
```

### Piped Input

```bash
echo "explain this code" | koda
cat error.log | koda "what went wrong?"
git diff | koda "review these changes"
```
